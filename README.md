# WebGLApp
A simple WebGL application that, using Three.js, loads 3D models into the app and allows the user to rescale them and move them.


1 - Insert the URL of the 3D model
2 - Click "Load"

Note: The "Models" folder contains some example models. To load any of them, insert in the input field:

"http://localhost:8000/Models/[modelfilename]"
